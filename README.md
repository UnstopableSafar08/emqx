Message Queue

EMQX is a cloud-native, MQTT-based, IoT messaging platform designed for high reliability and massive scale. EMQX is a tool in the Message Queue category of a tech stack. 
EMQX is currently the most scalable MQTT broker for IoT applications. It processes millions of MQTT messages in a second with sub-millisecond latency and allows messaging among more than 100 million clients within a single cluster. EMQX is compliant with MQTT 5.0 and 3.x. Itâ€™s ideal for distributed IoT networks and can run on the cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. The broker can implement MQTT over TLS/SSL and supports several authentication mechanisms like PSK, JWT, and X.509. Unlike Mosquitto, EMQX supports clustering via CLI, HTTP API, and a Dashboard.
